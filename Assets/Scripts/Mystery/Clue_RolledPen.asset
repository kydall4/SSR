  arguments:
  - optionText: This is a $500 fountain pen. He wouldn't just kick it under the desk
      and leave it there.
    chiefResponse: He was about to end his life. I doubt he was worried about the
      resale value of his stationery.
    isCorrectLogic: 0
  - optionText: It didn't just fall. Look at the ink splatter on the chair leg. It
      hit hard and rolled while uncapped. He didn't drop it; he collapsed mid-sentence.
    chiefResponse: Collapsed? ...Wait. If he fell unconscious in his chair... then
      how did he open the window?
    isCorrectLogic: 1
  - optionText: It's under the desk. He must have been crawling around looking for
      it and hit his head.
    chiefResponse: And then he stood up and jumped out the window in frustration?
      That's your theory? Please.
