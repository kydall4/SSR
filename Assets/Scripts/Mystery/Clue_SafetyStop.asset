  arguments:
  - optionText: He was desperate to get air. He must have ripped it off with his
      bare hands in a panic.
    chiefResponse: With his bare hands? That stop is solid steel held by 3-inch screws.
      He would have broken his fingers, not the metal.
    isCorrectLogic: 0
  - optionText: Look at the screws. They aren't stripped or bent. Someone used a
      screwdriver to remove this cleanly. A suicidal man in distress doesn't stop
      to perform home maintenance.
    chiefResponse: A screwdriver? ...You're saying someone intentionally widened
      the opening to fit a body through? That implies premeditation.
    isCorrectLogic: 1
  - optionText: The building is old. It probably just fell off when he leaned against
      the glass, and he tumbled out.
    chiefResponse: Fell off? The screws are sitting in a neat pile right next to
      it. That wasn't an accident; it was disassembled.
